# Advanced Smart Inventory Stock Management System

## Overview

The **Advanced Smart Inventory Stock Management System** project follows a structured and iterative approach to develop a robust inventory management solution. This project aims to demonstrate the application of software engineering principles, from initial proposals and requirement analysis to design, implementation, and testing, using real-world methodologies.

The project is divided into multiple weekly tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of software development. These tasks include analyzing software process models, defining requirements, creating system designs, and implementing/testing selected use cases. The final outcome is a well-documented and functional prototype tailored for small to mid-sized businesses.
