    "## 1.1. Why Professional Software is More than Just the Developed Programs\n",
    "Professional software developed for a customer involves more than just the code or programs delivered. It also includes documentation, maintenance, user support, testing, and training. This is because software must be maintained over time, updated to meet changing requirements, and supported to ensure it continues functioning as expected. Additionally, software must be thoroughly tested to ensure it meets the customer's needs and is free of defects.\n",

    "The key difference between generic software product development and custom software development is that generic software is designed for a broad range of users and applications, while custom software is created to meet the specific needs of a particular client. In practice, this means that users of generic software products may need to adapt their processes to fit the software, whereas custom software is tailored to fit the exact requirements of the customer. Generic software may not meet every user's ne...\n",
